# Gedit Dark Theme

Plugin to make Gedit use your theme's dark variant, just like [Totem][1],
[Boxes][2] or [Eye of Gnome][3] do.

## Installation

Download and extract the ZIP into your plugin directory, usually located at
`~/.local/share/gedit/plugins/`, or clone the repository using `git`:

```sh
mkdir -p ~/.local/share/gedit/plugins
cd ~/.local/share/gedit/plugins
git clone https://github.com/fernzi/gedit-darktheme.git
```

Then restart gedit and activate the plugin on the preferences dialog.
